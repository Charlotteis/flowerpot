# Getting Started

Hi, thanks for your interest in flowerpot development! Let's get you set up.

First, you'll want to install github and node on your computer.

* [github](desktop.github.com)
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (use an installer)

Now, open a terminal window / command prompt and run the following

* `npm install -g bower`
* `npm install -g ember-cli`

Next, click the 'save to computer' button on the flowerpot repository github page; this will clone the repo to your machine.

* `bower install`

After this is complete you should be good to go! Just run `ember server` and [load the app in your browser](http://localhost:4200/)!
